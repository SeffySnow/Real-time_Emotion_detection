# Real-time_Emotion_detection
Real‚Äêtime facial emotion detection using YOLOv8 and Flask

## Project Goal
This repository contains a YOLOv8-based real-time emotion detection application. The goal is to run a pretrained YOLOv8 model on live webcam input (or video frames) to detect facial expressions and classify them into nine categories: angry, contempt, disgust, fear, happy, natural, sad, sleepy, and surprised.

## Project Setup

- **Git LFS** (only if you clone the repo fresh and need to fetch `models/best.pt`)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with webcam support

---

1. **Clone the repository** (with LFS enabled)
2. Change directory to /app
3. install requirements ( pip install -r requirements.txt)

4. run the app on local server (python app.py)
